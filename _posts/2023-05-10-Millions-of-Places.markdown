It is amazing, yet, horrifying.    
For the last 12 years, I've seen many people, I've seen many places on the internet.    
I don't know, many things have changed, but many things didn't. It's amazing, yet, horrifying, that people make a home from places on the internet.    
Perhaps millions of places are now homes to people living on the internet. I wonder if it's good or bad to see internet groups, channels, and other places like that become home to people and their memories and experiences like never seen in the history of humans.    
For the last decade, I have been roaming the internet; I surfed everywhere I could, read everything I could, watched how people interact with each other, and formed societies, or better to say, a shadow of society on the internet. It's horrifying because I see how a group or channel is like a home to someone and hosts their memories, maybe forever.    
There are millions of these homes out there. I don't know; maybe it's just me being horrified to see how small we see while there are millions of homes and experiences that we will never get a chance to see.    
It's scary how much Iâ€™ll miss...
